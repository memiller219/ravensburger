# RAVENSBURGER INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT

Hello all!  Thank you for taking the time to review this assessment.  I had a fun and enjoyable time working on this.  I hope I exceed or at least meet the expectations for this position.  I am eagerly looking forward to hearing back from you.  

## OPTIMIZATIONS I WOULD INCORPORATE WITH MORE TIME

1. Compress Images in carousel.
2. Add more META tags and description for improving SEO.
3. Add functionality on 'zoom in' icon for carousel.
4. Improve styling of carousel buttons/index indicator to match that of original website.
5. Add description of puzzle (if that was necessary? )
6. Use a webpack/docker extension to compress the file size. 
7. Separate api calls to other folders related to more server components. 


### TO RUN APPLICATION

Just a simple yarn start/npm start, whichever you prefer :)
